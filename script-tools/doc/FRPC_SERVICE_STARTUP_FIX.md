# Windows Installer - FRPC Service Startup Fix
> **Category:** Historical

**Date:** 2025-11-07 (FRPC Diagnostics & Fix)  
**Status:** FIXED - Installation Script Updated  
**Commit:** 90229ce

## Problem Identified

After running the installer, CheckMK Agent installed successfully, but **FRPC service didn't start automatically**.

### Diagnostic Results

**Positive Findings:**
- FRPC executable: Present at `C:\Program Files\frp\frpc.exe`
- Configuration file: Correct at `C:\ProgramData\frp\frpc.toml`
- Service registered: `sc.exe qc frpc` showed proper configuration
- **MANUAL EXECUTION: WORKS PERFECTLY!**

**Test Output (manual run):**
```
2025-11-07 16:29:33.916 [I] start frpc service
2025-11-07 16:29:34.004 [I] trying to connect to server...
2025-11-07 16:29:34.354 [I] login to server success
2025-11-07 16:29:34.355 [I] proxy added: [<tunnel-name>]
2025-11-07 16:29:34.450 [I] [<tunnel-name>] start proxy success
```

**Problem:**
- Service wouldn't auto-start when registered with `sc.exe create`
- Calling `Start-Service` immediately after registration failed
- Service status remained "Stopped"

---

## Root Causes

The script created the service and immediately tried to start it without:
1. Sufficient delay for service registration to complete
2. Retry logic in case of timing issues
3. Proper verification before declaring success

---

## Solution Implemented

### Changes to `install-agent-interactive.ps1`

**Before:**
```powershell
sc.exe create frpc binPath= "$frpcPath -c $tomlFile" start= auto ...
Start-Service -Name "frpc" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Start-Sleep-Seconds 2
# Check if running (fails)
```

**After:**
```powershell
# 1. Register service
Invoke-Expression $createCmd 2>$null
Start-Sleep-Seconds 1

# 2. Verify service was created
$frpcService = Get-Service -Name "frpc" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if (-not $frpcService) { return $false }

# 3. Retry logic for startup (up to 3 attempts)
$maxRetries = 3
$retryCount = 0
$serviceRunning = $false

While ($retryCount -lt $maxRetries -and -not $serviceRunning) {
    $retryCount++
    Start-Service -Name "frpc" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 3 # Increased wait
    
    $frpcService = Get-Service -Name "frpc" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    if ($frpcService.Status -eq "Running") {
        $serviceRunning = $true
        Write-Host "[OK] Service started"
    }
    elseif ($retryCount -lt $maxRetries) {
        Stop-Service -Name "frpc" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        Start-Sleep-Seconds 1
    }
}

#4. Better user feedback
if (-not $serviceRunning) {
    Write-Host "[WARN] Service created but not started (will start on next boot)"
    Write-Host "[INFO] Manual start: Start-Service -Name 'frpc'"
}
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Longer Delays:**
   - Added proper wait times between service creation and startup
   - Increased wait after Start-Service call from 2 to 3 seconds

2. **Retry Logic:**
   - Attempts to start service up to 3 times
   - Between retries: stop service, wait, then retry
   - Prevents single timing issues from failing entire process

3. **Better Verification:**
   - Checks if service exists after creation
   - Validates service is actually running before claiming success
   - Returns false if critical errors occur

4. **Improved Diagnostics:**
   - Shows which retry attempt is running
   - Displays config and log file locations
   - Provides manual command if auto-start fails
   - Shows friendly messages instead of silent failures

5. **Graceful Fallback:**
   - If service doesn't auto-start, it's set to AUTO_START
   - Will start on next Windows boot
   - User can manually start with: `Start-Service -Name 'frpc'`

## Testing the Fix

### How to Test

1. **Uninstall previous FRPC:**
   ```powershell
   .\install-agent-interactive.ps1 --uninstall-frpc
   ```

2. **Run installer again:**
   ```powershell
   .\install-agent-interactive.ps1
   ```

3. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   [*] Creating Windows Service...
       [*] Stopping existing service...
       [*] Removing previous service...
       [*] Windows Service Logging...
       [OK] Service registered
       [*] Startup attempt (1/3)...
       [OK] FRPC service started successfully
   
   [OK] FRPC Configuration:
       Server: <your-checkmk-server>:7000
       Tunnel: <tunnel-name>
       Remote port: 6010
       Local port: 6556
       Config: C:\ProgramData\frp\frpc.toml
Log: C:\ProgramData\frp\logs\frpc.log
   ```

4. **Verify Service:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Service -Name 'frpc' | Format-List Name, Status, StartType
   # Expected: Running, Automatic
   ```

5. **Check Connectivity:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content 'C:\ProgramData\frp\logs\frpc.log' -Tail 20
   # Should show: "proxy added: [<tunnel-name>]" and "start proxy success"
   ```

## Technical Details

### Service Registration

The service is registered with:
- **Name:** `frpc`
- **Display Name:** `FRP Client Service`
- **Binary Path:** `C:\Program Files\frp\frpc.exe -c C:\ProgramData\frp\frpc.toml`
- **Start Type:** `Automatic` (AUTO_START)
- **Account:** `LocalSystem`

### Service Startup Flow

1. Service registered with Windows (via `sc.exe create`)
2. Service verified to exist
3. Service start attempted (with retry logic)
4. Verification that service is actually running
5. User feedback on success/failure

### Fallback Behavior

If service fails to start immediately:
- Service is still set to `AUTO_START`
- Will start automatically on next Windows boot
- User can manually start: `Start-Service -Name 'frpc'`
- Logs will show any connection errors

### If Service Still Doesn't Start

If the service still doesn't start automatically, you can:

1. **Manual Start:**
   ```powershell
   Start-Service -Name 'frpc'
   ```

2. **View Logs:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content 'C:\ProgramData\frp\logs\frpc.log' -Tail 50 -Wait
   ```

3. **Check Configuration:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content 'C:\ProgramData\frp\frpc.toml'
   ```

4. **Connectivity Test:**
   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <your-checkmk-server> -Port 7000
   ```

### Expected Log Output

Successful connection shows:
```
[I] login to server success, get run id [xxxxx]
[I] proxy added: [<tunnel-name>]
[I] [<tunnel-name>] start proxy success
```

Error scenarios:
```
[E] dial tcp: connect refused # Server not responding
[E] token auth failed # Wrong authentication token
[E] EOF # Connection interrupted
```
